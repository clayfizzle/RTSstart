Surviving scientist on a post-apocolyptic planet, 
OR that just defended itself against a technologically advanced alien invasion.

This gives us our 3 recources (plus metal):

  * Software
  * Biomass
  * Energy / Power cells
  * METAL

Resource harvesting:
Towns / Ruins, Crash sites and Military dropspots are "scavanged" for the different resource types.
  
  * Plots are few and far between and are not "sprawling" but are instead only a few "squares" in area making them eay to miss
  * Scavanging results in HUGE payoffs but only rarely and plots DON'T replenish
  * This way would play out better if the resources were single resource plots that a player could decide 
    to bypass instead of "waisting" there time. 

  * Maybe you can't tell from looking at a resource what it is.  You have to do a "test mine".  "does this suck"???

Mutant path:
  
  * METAL
  * Software
  * Biomass

Robot path:

  * METAL
  * Software
  * Energy / Powercells

Human path:
  
  * METAL
  * Energy / Powercells
  * Biomass

Map characteristics:

  * Procedurally generated
  * Day/Night cycle
  * Night cycle spawns "enemies"
  * Night will be bad for Humans; reduced visability, slower movement? etc...
  * Day will be bad for Mutants; reduced visability, more damage? etc...
  * Robots might overheat during the day and spend too much power at night (cuz they're solar and THE STRONGEST)
  * 4 part day cycle: 2min per cycle; 1day = 8min (10sec graphic "cycle warning"?)
      day = bad for mutant, bad for robots
      night = bad for humans, bad for robots
      dawn / dusk = even odds, for robots too
  * only one level (just barriers). 
  * ?? water ??  do different terrains spawn different "enemies"; does a map with no desert fail to produce "enemies" w/venom?

Avatar: Yes

  * The robot upgrading could depend on it as the "final piece" to teching-up (the brain-throne idea)
  * The mutants would give the ability to pull a "Mr. Hyde" / Berserker rage
  * The humans would get shafted on the avatar upgrading unless they had some kind of "moral" bonus.

About Nomad-style play:

  * Instead of using the lab you start in you decide to scavange it (this would make your avatar mad buff so you could last the night solo)
    and your focus is now solely on attack; some kind of "siege" capability
  * Your units would be the buffest in the game (maybe 2nd to the mutants; I'm thinking 25-35 maxed out nomads could win the game)
    "all" your resources would be spent on converting tech into weapons, even if you used alien tech or pre-war tech 
    you'd pretty much just make weapons with it (with a few exceptions; guard dogs/elec fences/better scavenging)

People: are only "recruited"; you never "make" humans

  * People would be the only unit resource.
  * Your units would only come from NPCs who either joined or got caught (with the possible exception of the "robot path").
  * As you recruited more humans and gained greater tech you would spend "regular" resources "outfitting" individuals instead of making new higher level units
  * They would need to regenerate so that when they retreated they would eventually recover (I wanted this to take "food"?)
  * People (NPCs) COULD just wander around everywhere outside (during the day) and when they saw you they would just join you (if you had humans)
  * People could also be spawned at a steady rate from "cities".  If you even harvested the population below 2 (ha ha) the "city" 
    would die out and be dead for the rest of the game.
  * Robots and mutants would have to "catch" humans but NPC humans are drawn to other humans (IF hum > robo+mut = join freely)

Teching up:
Devices VS Structures

  * Structures allow an enemy to destroy your tech
  * Devices allow an enemy to destroy your tech (AND steal it?)
  *

Tech Tree:

  So the one I drew (on google drive) starts at the stars for each pure "tech path".  The non-colored nodes are 
  "in-between tech" that are a combo of the surounding tech-types.  The humans are in the middle so they have 
  access to all three kinds of tech.  The othe two paths do not.  This is hella easy fix by creating a third grey node series 
  inbetween the Mutant and Robot paths to make a "tech cylinder" (also on google drive).  I did it the non-cylinder way just to be able to ensure the
  Humans ability to be more diverse. But I don't know if it's fair not having a way to "get from" mutants to robots.
