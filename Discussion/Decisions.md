We have two games in mind so far. One can be neatly described as a Fallout RTS. The other is Dwarf Fortress done right.

I'll be giving my own view of the following for each game:
* Strategy
* Action
* Intuitiveness
* Graphical Information
* Coding Difficulty

Rating 1-5 stars (*)
Higher is always better.


+-------------+
| Fallout RTS |
+-------------+

=== Strategy (*** Three Stars) ===

Wander around and hope to get resources you need. Strategy partly revolves around working with what you got.
Different tech paths you choose will affect how you play. Playing optimally will require you to be adaptable.
Scouting marginally important. Need to adjust and make decisions on the fly. Lots of unknowns will be thrown at you.

=== Action (***** Five Stars) ===

Switches between night and day force you to alter your train of thought and change from exploration to defense.
Constant fear of unknown. Random enemies, resources, terrain, and its difficult to figure out what your opponent is up to.

=== Intuitiveness (*** Three Stars) ===

Lots of different units. Knowing how all of them behave could be difficult. Tech trees and different resource useage adds further levels of complexity to decisions. May be easy to screw yourself over with a decision and be unable to recover from it. How random events and the environment (including NPC's) work could be hard for new players to get.

=== Graphical Information (*** Three Stars) ===

Requires who knows how many different graphics.
What can that mutant do? What can that robot do? You'll have to guess what kind of tech your opponent has chosen.
It's possible that mutant can jump 20 meters and explode in a shower of acid. Does that leader have the ability to super charge his troops with morale or does he simply have a big gun? Things aren't always what they appear to be.

=== Coding Difficulty (** Two Stars) ===

Requires different AI's for different types of units. Terrain generation, random event generation, and UI are major challenges. Tech trees, mutations, special abilities, and NPC interaction. 



+----------------+
| Dwarf Fortress |
+----------------+

=== Strategy (***** Five Stars) ===

This game forces you to think in 3 dimensions.
You must plan your base to be efficient and easily defendable.
Scouting, theiving, planning, and countering are all prevalent.

=== Action (** Two Stars) ===

You may be simply mining and laying out your base for extended periods of time.
Plans you set into motion may take a long time to pan out (like flooding your opponents base with lava).
May be micro and or macro intensive forcing you to click quite a bit to get things done.
(Do we want to focus on macro or micro?)

=== Intuitiveness (*** Three Stars) ===

The game will try to work as realistically as possible (with floods and dynamite doing what you expect).
Resources may be a little clunky. You stockpile them on the ground in designated areas.
Units may not behave in predictable ways. They will try and find work to do but it may not be what you expect.

=== Graphical Information (**** Four Stars) ===

The graphics can be incredibly easy to produce.
Units do not have hidden power or abilities from a tech tree. Everything is clearly visible on each unit.
When you see a unit with a spear and a shield, you aren't wondering if your opponent researched,
 "Divine Weapons of Infinite Damage."

=== Coding Difficulty (*** Three Stars) ===

Pathfinding, terrain generation, and the UI are the major challenges. Determining how we want units to behave could be difficult as well.
